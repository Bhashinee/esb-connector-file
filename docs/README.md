# File Connector Version 2

WSO2 EI File [Connector](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI611/Working+with+Connectors) version 2 allows you to connect to 
different file systems and perform various operations with the file systems. It uses the Apache Commons VFS I/O 
functionalities to execute operations.

And also it introduces the atomic operation related to the file system and allows you to easily manipulate files based 
on your requirement. The file streaming functionality using Apache Commons I/O lets you copy large files and reduces 
the file transfer time between two file systems resulting in a significant improvement in performance that can be 
utilized in file operations.

## Getting started

To get started and perform various operations with the connector, go to [Working with the File Connector](topics.md).
